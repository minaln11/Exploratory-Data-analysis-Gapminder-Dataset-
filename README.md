# Exploratory-Data-analysis-Gapminder-Dataset-

The project has three parts
In the first part, we explore life expectancy across countries using Gapminder data. The dataset is cleaned and basic explorations are perfomed. Life expectancy trends over time for selected countries are visualized. Using regression we model life expectancy. On a Italian restaurant dataset a logistic regression model is built to predict which restaurant is expensive. The importance of confidence level in regression models are discussed and they are evaluated to understand which one is better.
