The project is divided into two main parts: "Explore Life Expectancy" and "Model Life Expectancy."

In the "Explore Life Expectancy" section, the dataset is preprocessed to remove missing and irrelevant data. Various insights are derived, such as the number of unique countries, the range of years with valid life expectancy data, and the lowest and highest life expectancy values. The analysis also identifies historical events that significantly impacted life expectancy, such as the Cambodian Genocide.

In the "Model Life Expectancy" section, linear regression is used to model life expectancy against the year, and later, logistic regression is applied to predict whether a restaurant is cheap or expensive based on various ratings.

The logistic regression model for restaurant prediction includes variables such as food, decor, service, and location. The analysis shows that food and decor ratings significantly impact whether a restaurant is classified as cheap or expensive, whereas service and east location (5th Avenue) do not have a significant effect.

The project concludes by recommending the best model for predicting restaurant prices based on its accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, it summarizes the insights gained from the data exploration and modeling phases.
